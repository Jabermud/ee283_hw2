## README

The purpose of this README is to answer the questions listed in week 2 lab.

Questions:

1. The function that instructs Rstudio to use reticulate is `library(reticulate)`

2. To shell command that I used find my python installation is: `which python`

3. `include = FALSE` piece of code instructs knitr not to display in the hides the line of code `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`.

4. The removal of the final semicolon renders a commented output that reads as follows:

        ## <seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid object at 0x7ffdef51cac0>

    Including the semi-colon supresses this output in the html rendering.
